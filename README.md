# ProjectC
All Code and Assets Used in this solo, independent project "Project C" will be posted here and availible for public uses. 
All code are free to use, HOWEVER assets (in particularly sprites designed/created by me, needs to be credit if used)

Description:
Project C is an in-progress, independent, solo project where I try to create a turn-based RPG. This project is heavily influenced by Octopath Traveler for its visual and turn-based system, Yazuka: Like A Dragon for its bizarre aesthetics, and hopefully implement some Professor Layton inspired puzzle into the game. The player plays as a Japanese student who finds himself living in an anime/manga like life at school. Throughout the game, players will encounter other students (such as the student body officer, class president, bullies, etc.) and "fight" them in a turn-based system and solve puzzles that are scattered throughout the school building.

Note: There will be a part where you will end up fighting the class fish, either you are trying to reach a clue that is in the tank or something. I don't know.
